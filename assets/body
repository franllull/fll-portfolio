Thoughts after a year after living without Facebook


---- contact ----

I'm a detail-oriented web designer, passionate about the use of emotional design in interactive technologies. I focus on making it useful, accessible, understandable, beautiful and long-lasting. My main fields are responsive web design, CSS3, and typography.

In case you ask, I'd say life is about learning all the time, enjoying it and developing awareness of nature. 
The future belongs to the curious. http://vimeo.com/34853044
